What questions should you ask the interviewer?
Most interviewers will give you a chance to ask them questions. The quality of your questions will be a
factor, whether subconsciously or consciously, in their decisions. Walk into the interview with some ques­
tions in mind.
You can think about three general types of questions.
Genuine Questions
These are the questions you actually want to know the answers to. Here are a few ideas of questions that
are valuable to many candidates:
1. "What is the ratio of testers to developers to program managers? What is the interaction like? How does
project planning happen on the team?"
2. "What brought you to this company? What has been most challenging for you?"
These questions will give you a good feel for what the day-to-day life is like at the company.
Insightful Questions
These questions demonstrate your knowledge or understanding of technology.
1. "I noticed that you use technology X. How do you handle problem Y?"
2. "Why did the product choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol? I know it has benefits like A, B,
C, but many companies choose not to use it because of issue o:'
Asking such questions will typically require advance research about the company.
Passion Questions
These questions are designed to demonstrate your passion for technology. They show that you're inter­
ested in learning and will be a strong contributor to the company.
1. 'Tm very interested in scalability, and I'd love to learn more about it. What opportunities are there at this
company to learn about this?"
2. "I'm not familiar with technology X, but it sounds like a very interesting solution. Could you tell me a bit
more about how it works?"
